Okay, let's break down these CSS snippets, focusing on less common properties, their meanings, and compatibility considerations.  I've grouped related sections for clarity.

**1. Hiding Scrollbars (Repeated Pattern):**

```css
scrollbar-width: none;  /* Firefox */
-ms-overflow-style: none;  /* IE 10+ */
&::-webkit-scrollbar {
  display: none;  /* Chrome, Safari, Opera */
}
```

*   **`scrollbar-width: none;`**:  (Firefox) Hides the scrollbar.  Standard CSS property, but primarily effective in Firefox.
*   **`-ms-overflow-style: none;`**: (IE 10+)  Microsoft-specific property to hide scrollbars in older IE versions.
*   **`&::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }`**: (WebKit: Chrome, Safari, Opera) Hides scrollbars using a WebKit-specific pseudo-element.

*   **Compatibility:** This trio is the standard cross-browser way to hide scrollbars while *keeping the content scrollable*.  It covers the major browser families.

**2. `object-fit` (Repeated):**

```css
.item_image, .listData_img, .tabelimage, .Pet_img_top, .Pet_img_down_icon,.upload_img,.img_box,.avatar_img {
  object-fit: cover; /* OR */
  object-fit: contain;
}
```

*   **`object-fit`**: Controls how the content of a *replaced element* (like `<img>`, `<video>`) is resized to fit its container.
    *   `cover`:  The image is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while completely filling the container.  Parts of the image might be clipped.
    *   `contain`: The image is scaled to maintain its aspect ratio while fitting *inside* the container.  The entire image is visible, but there might be empty space (letterboxing).

*   **Compatibility:**  `object-fit` is well-supported in modern browsers.  For IE, you can use a polyfill like `object-fit-images`.

**3. Text Overflow (Repeated):**

```css
.AIToolsList_down_mask p, .ViewAllList_data_title, .bad_box_txt, .input_box, .Style_card_title, .title_box p{
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    white-space: nowrap;
}

.AIToolsList_down_mask p {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 3;
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
}
```
*   **Single-Line Overflow:**
    *   **`overflow: hidden;`**:  Hides any content that overflows the element's box.
    *   **`text-overflow: ellipsis;`**:  If text overflows *horizontally*, display an ellipsis (`...`) to indicate hidden content.  *Crucially, this only works with `overflow: hidden` (or `scroll`) and `white-space: nowrap`.*
    *   **`white-space: nowrap;`**:  Prevents text from wrapping to the next line.

*  **Multi-Line Overflow (WebKit-specific):**
    * **`display: -webkit-box;`**: Enables an older version of the flexbox layout (specifically for WebKit).
    * **`-webkit-line-clamp: 3;`**:  *Limits the text to a specific number of lines* (3 in this case).  This is a *non-standard, WebKit-only* property.
    * **`-webkit-box-orient: vertical;`**: Specifies that the box's children should be laid out vertically.

*   **Compatibility:**
    *   Single-line overflow (`overflow`, `text-overflow`, `white-space`) is widely supported.
    *   Multi-line overflow with `-webkit-line-clamp` is *only* supported in WebKit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari, some mobile browsers).  There is *no* cross-browser, pure-CSS solution for multi-line ellipsis.  JavaScript-based solutions are often necessary for broader compatibility.

**4. Grid Layout (Repeated):**

```css
.good_box, .bad_box, .ViewAllList_data, .Style_box_down, .tabel_card, .flexDataList, .upload_file_list, .sample_image_list,.History_Cardbox, .AIToolsList_down_box  {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); /* OR variations */
  gap: 10px 10px; /* OR variations */
}

.flexDataList{
   grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(114px, 1fr));
}
```

*   **`display: grid;`**:  Turns the element into a grid container.
*   **`grid-template-columns`**: Defines the columns of the grid.
    *   `repeat(4, 1fr)`: Creates four columns, each taking up an equal fraction (`1fr`) of the available space.
    *  `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(114px, 1fr))`: Creates as many columns as will fit in the container, with each column having a minimum width of 114px and a maximum width of 1fr (expanding to fill available space). `auto-fill` creates implicit tracks, filling extra space, while `auto-fit` collapses empty tracks.
*   **`gap`**: Sets the spacing (gutters) between grid items (both rows and columns).  `gap: 10px 10px` means 10px horizontal and 10px vertical gap.

*   **Compatibility:** Grid Layout is well-supported in modern browsers.  IE 10 and 11 have partial support with an older syntax (using `-ms-` prefixes), but it's often best to use an Autoprefixer to handle this automatically.

**5. `aspect-ratio`:**

```css
.item img {
    aspect-ratio: 1;
}
```
*  **`aspect-ratio`**:  Sets a preferred aspect ratio for the box.  This is used to calculate the size of the box in one dimension if the other dimension is known or constrained.  `aspect-ratio: 1` means a 1:1 aspect ratio (a square).

*   **Compatibility:** `aspect-ratio` is a relatively new property, but it's now widely supported in modern browsers. For older browsers, you might need to use a padding-bottom hack or JavaScript to maintain the aspect ratio.

**6. `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` (Repeated):**

```css
span, .Filter_lineWrapper span {
  -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```

*   **`-webkit-tap-highlight-color`**: (WebKit, mobile)  Controls the color that briefly appears when a user taps a link or clickable element on a *touchscreen device*.  `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` makes it transparent (effectively disabling the highlight).

*   **Compatibility:** This is a WebKit-specific property, primarily relevant for mobile Safari (iOS) and Chrome on Android.

**7. `pointer-events` (Repeated):**

```css
.item_image, .upload_img, .itemSelectBox, .upload_icon {
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

*   **`pointer-events`**:  Controls whether an element can be the target of mouse events (clicks, hovers, etc.).
    *   `none`:  The element *never* receives pointer events.  Clicks "pass through" to elements beneath it.

*   **Compatibility:** `pointer-events` is well-supported.

**8. `resize` (Textarea):**
```css
    .textarea {
        /* ... */
        resize: none
    }
```
* **`resize`**:  Controls whether an element (typically a `<textarea>`) can be resized by the user.
    *   `none`:  Prevents resizing.
    *   `both`: Allows both horizontal and vertical resizing (the default for textareas).
    *   `horizontal`: Allows only horizontal resizing.
    *   `vertical`: Allows only vertical resizing.

* **Compatibility**: `resize` is well supported in modern browsers.

**9. `user-select`:**

```css
.dropdownSelected {
  user-select: none;
}
```
*   **`user-select`**:  Controls whether the user can select text within an element.
    *   `none`:  Prevents text selection.
    *   `text`:  Allows text selection (the default).
    *   `all`:  Allows selection with a single click.
    *   `auto`:  Behavior determined by the browser (usually similar to `text`).

* **Compatibility**: `user-select` is well-supported, but for older browsers, you may need prefixes: `-webkit-user-select`, `-moz-user-select`, `-ms-user-select`.

**10. `backdrop-filter` (Not present in *this* code, but mentioned in previous examples):**

   *   Not present in *these* snippets, but worth mentioning since it came up before:  `backdrop-filter` applies a filter effect (like blur, grayscale, etc.) to the area *behind* an element.  It's like `filter`, but it affects what's *beneath*, not the element itself.
   *   Requires `-webkit-backdrop-filter` for Safari.

**11. `visibility` vs. `opacity` and `display`:**

```css
    .left_icon_img,
    .right_icon_img {
      /* ... */
      visibility: hidden; // 使用visibility代替opacity控制显隐
      transition: visibility 0s, opacity 0.3s ease; // 添加transition效果
    }

    .top_img_box:hover~.left_icon_img,
    .top_img_box:hover~.right_icon_img,
    .left_icon_img:hover,
    .right_icon_img:hover {
      visibility: visible; // 鼠标悬停时设置为可见
      opacity: 1 !important;
    }
```

*   **`visibility: hidden;`**:  Makes the element invisible, *but it still takes up space in the layout*.
*   **`opacity: 0;`**: Makes the element fully transparent, *but it still takes up space and can receive pointer events*.
*   **`display: none;`**:  Completely removes the element from the layout; it takes up no space and cannot receive events.

*   The code uses `visibility` for the hover effect *because* it wants the hidden elements to still occupy their space, preventing layout shifts when they become visible. The `transition` on `visibility` is set to `0s`, so that the `visibility` change is instant.
* Using `opacity: 1 !important` in the hover state is important. Without `!important` the `opacity` might not always override inline styles or more specific rules that could have set opacity to something else.

**12. CSS Variables (Custom Properties):**

```css
.item {
  background-color: var(--color_img_bg);
}
```

* **`var(--color_img_bg)`:** Uses a CSS variable (custom property) named `--color_img_bg`. CSS variables allow you to define reusable values that can be used throughout your stylesheet. They are declared using a double hyphen prefix (`--`).

*   **Compatibility:**  CSS variables are well-supported in modern browsers. IE11 does *not* support them.  If you need to support IE11, you'll need a build process (like PostCSS with a suitable plugin) to convert the variables to static values.

**13. `position: sticky`:**
```css
.Suspension_close_box {
    position: sticky;
    /* ... */
}
```
* **`position: sticky`**:  An element with `position: sticky` behaves like `position: relative` until it crosses a specified threshold (e.g., the top of the viewport), at which point it behaves like `position: fixed`, "sticking" to that position.

*   **Compatibility:** `position: sticky` is well-supported in modern browsers. For older browsers, you might need a JavaScript polyfill.

**14. `background: linear-gradient(...)`:**
```css
background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0));
```
* **`linear-gradient()`**: Creates a linear gradient background. This example creates a gradient that transitions from `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)` (semi-transparent black) at the bottom to `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` (fully transparent) at the top.
* **Compatibility:** Gradients are well-supported, but for older browsers, you may need to include vendor prefixes (`-webkit-linear-gradient`, `-moz-linear-gradient`, `-o-linear-gradient`).

**15. `box-shadow`:**

```css
box-shadow: 0px 5px 5px -3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0px 8px 10px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.14), 0px 3px 14px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12);
```

*   **`box-shadow`**:  Applies one or more shadows to an element. This example uses *three* shadows to create a more complex, layered effect.  Each shadow definition is comma-separated. The values are:
    *   `horizontal-offset`: Positive values move the shadow to the right; negative to the left.
    *   `vertical-offset`: Positive values move the shadow down; negative up.
    *   `blur-radius`:  Larger values create a more blurred shadow.
    *   `spread-radius` (optional):  Positive values expand the shadow; negative shrink it.
    *   `color`: The shadow's color.

*   **Compatibility:** `box-shadow` is well-supported.  For very old browsers (IE8 and earlier), you could use a polyfill, but it's often not worth the effort.

**16. `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(114px, 1fr))`**:

   * I explained this above with the grid section, but it's important enough to reiterate.
   * `auto-fill`: Tries to fit as many columns (or rows) of the specified size as possible into the container, *creating implicit grid tracks* as needed, even if they are empty.
   * `minmax(114px, 1fr)`:  Defines a size range.  Each column will be *at least* 114px wide, and will expand to take up an equal share (`1fr`) of the remaining space.

**17. `inset` (Not in *this* code, but relevant from previous):**

    *   Not present in *these* examples, but `inset` is a shorthand for `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`.  For example, `inset: 0;` is equivalent to `top: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0;`.  It's commonly used with absolutely or fixed positioned elements.

**18. Material-UI (MUI) Specific Styles:**

```css
.MuiTabs-indicator {
  display: none;
}

.MuiTab-root {
 /* ... */
}
.main-tabs .Mui-selected{
/* ... */
}
.MuiOutlinedInput-notchedOutline {
  border: none !important;
}
```

*   These selectors target specific elements within the Material-UI (MUI) component library.  MUI uses CSS-in-JS, and these classes are used to override the default styles of MUI components.  The specific properties (like hiding the tab indicator or styling the selected tab) are standard CSS, but the selectors are specific to MUI's structure.  If you're not using MUI, these won't have any effect.

**19. `z-index` (Repeated):**

* **`z-index`**: Controls the stacking order of positioned elements (elements with `position` other than `static`).  Elements with a higher `z-index` appear on top of elements with a lower `z-index`.  It only works on positioned elements.

**20. `flex-shrink`:**

* Although not explicitly set in the code, the default value of `flex-shrink` is 1.  In the `.Pet_img_down_box` class,  `flex-shrink: 0` is commented out.
* `flex-shrink`: Specifies how much the flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items in the flex container when there isn't enough space on the main-axis. If set to 0, the item will not shrink.

**21. `flex: 1`**
 * `.craft_item_left`, `.AppPage_item_left`
 *  `flex: 1` is a shorthand for:
	 *  `flex-grow: 1`: The item will grow to fill available space in the flex container.
	 *  `flex-shrink: 1`: The item can shrink if there is not enough space.
	 * `flex-basis: 0%`: The initial size of the item is 0.

In summary, this CSS code demonstrates a good awareness of cross-browser compatibility, utilizing techniques like vendor prefixes, fallbacks (e.g., `setTimeout` for `requestIdleCallback`), and standard CSS properties where possible. It also leverages newer CSS features like Grid Layout, `aspect-ratio`, and CSS variables, while providing necessary workarounds (or notes about workarounds) for older browsers when needed. The code also shows good practices for handling images (object-fit), text overflow, and user interactions (pointer-events, user-select). The use of `!important` is generally discouraged unless absolutely necessary, as it can make CSS harder to maintain and debug. However, in a few places like overriding styles from UI libraries or ensuring a hover state is applied, its use can be justified.
